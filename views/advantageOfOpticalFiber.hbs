                        <h2>The Advantages of Optical Fiber over Traditional Copper Wiring</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog_para">
                        <p>Fiber optic cables are one of the fastest growing transmission media for new cable
                            installations and upgrades, including spine, horizontal, and even desktop applications.
                            Fiberglass has several advantages over copper. To date, our best home internet option has
                            been the love-hate wired connection that most of us are familiar with. <br><br>
                            Sometimes it's fast. But like the rush hour highways, it gets crowded during rush hours. We
                            cannot meet the growing needs of the Internet.

                        <h3>What is Fiber Optics?</h3>
                        <p>Fiber Internet works by splitting files such as movies and games into null packets and some
                            data packets. The laser irradiates one end of a plastic or glass filament with this Morse
                            code-style signal. The "line" is about as thick as the thread of human hair. <br><br>
                            A unique shell called cladding holds the rays inside the filament. It bounces off the wall
                            for up to 60 miles, with the other end popping out. The modem decodes the light into a
                            format that the computer can use.</p>

                        <h3>Advantages of preferring Fiber Optics over Copper wiring: - </h3>


                        <h4>Less attenuation and longer distance </h4>
                        <p>TFiber optic signals are light, so there is little signal loss during transmission, and data
                            can be transmitted at higher speeds and distances. Fiber optics do not have an unshielded
                            twisted pair copper wire (without booster) cap of 100 meters (9328 feet). <br><br>
                            Fiber lengths range from 300 meters (984.2 feet) to 40 kilometers (24.8 miles), depending on
                            the cable type, wavelength, and network. Fiber optic signals are less amplified than copper
                            signals, which improves cable performance.

                        <h4>Immunity and reliability </h4>
                        <p>Fiber optics provide highly reliable data transmission. It is not affected by other
                            environmental factors that affect copper wire. Fiber optic cables can be laid next to
                            industrial plants without hesitation. Therefore, fibers are less susceptible to temperature
                            changes than copper and can be dissolved in water.</p>
                        <h4>Design</h4>
                        <p>
                            Fiberglass is lighter, more flexible, and more durable than copper wire. In addition, the
                            tensile strength of fiber optic cables is up to 10 times that of copper cables. Due to its
                            small size, it is easy to handle and requires even less space in the cable duct. Fiber is
                            still more difficult to terminate than copper wire, but advances in connectors have made it
                            easier to remove.<br><br>
                            Fiber optics are often easier to test than copper wire.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Migration </h4>
                        <p>The widespread use and low cost of media converters make copper wire to fiber conversion much
                            more accessible. The converter creates a seamless connection and allows you to use your
                            existing hardware. With the expected upgrade, fiber optics can be incorporated into the
                            network. </p>

                        <h4>Norms </h4>
                        <p>Approved in 2001, TIA / EIA-785 provides a cost-effective migration path from 10Mbps Ethernet
                            to 100Mbps Fast Ethernet Overfiber (100BASE-SX). The specification addendum addresses
                            weaknesses in transceiver design. In June 2002, the IEEE approved the IEEE 10 Gigabit
                            Ethernet (10-GbE) specification.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Cost </h4>
                        <p>Fiber optic cables, modules, and equipment costs are slowly declining. Fiber installation
                            costs are higher than copper wire due to the features required for termination. In general,
                            fiber is more expensive than copper in the short term, but it can be cheaper in a long time.
                            Fiber maintenance costs, downtime, and less connection equipment are typically low.
                            Therefore, using fiber reduces the need to rewire to improve network performance.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Bandwidth </h4>
                        <p>Investing in fiber internet will significantly increase your bandwidth capacity. Copper
                            infrastructure and TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) technology are inherently limited.
                            Originally designed to carry only voice calls, bandwidth requirements were not high. For
                            example, the T-1 can only transmit a throughput of 1.5Mbps. Also, due to the mechanism of
                            electrical signals, many wiring connections are limited by distance. <br><br>
                            Generally, Ethernet over Copper Service (EoC) is not available in the line is longer than
                            15,000 feet. Bandwidth transfer over fiber is invaluable for companies considering migrating
                            voice communications to Voice-over-IP (VoIP).

                        </p>
                        <h4>Security and Privacy </h4>
                        <p>Your data is secure with fiber optic cable. It doesn't emit a signal, so it's difficult to
                            hit. Tap the line, which will leak light and cause the entire device to malfunction, making
                            tracing very easy. You know if you're trying to break the physical integrity of a fiber
                            optic network. <br><br>
                            Fiber optic networks allow you to put all your electronics and hardware in one place, rather
                            than having a wiring closet for your equipment throughout your home. With increasing
                            cybersecurity awareness, fiber is promoted as a cost-effective way to quickly improve
                            Internet security.<br><br>

                            So, when choosing internet connectivity, the best option is the Optical Fiber over copper
                            wirings.
